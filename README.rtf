Main Points
File Input: Reads an external file (specified via command-line arguments) containing a list of integer numbers, one per line.
Quick Sort Implementation: Uses a recursive quick sort approach:
Pivot Selection: Chooses the last element in the list as the pivot.
Partitioning: Rearranges elements around the pivot, placing smaller ones to the left and larger ones to the right.
Recursive Calls: Sorts the sublists to the left and right of the pivot.
Output: Prints the sorted numbers to the console.
